This folder contains test remote libraries and their zipped contents, in
order to test transitive dependency resolution / download in GoFetch.
This is the dependency graph of the remote libraries:

                             rlib2
                               |
                               |
                               |
                               v
                  rlib1 ---> rlib3
                     \         |
                      \        |
                       \       v
                        ---> rlib4


            rlib5 ------> rlib6 (expect error: no BUILD file present)

Note that should you change any sources in this directories, you
should run `./zip_rlibs.sh`, which will re-zip the libraries
and place them in "zipfiles/github.com/fakeuser/‚Äù.
