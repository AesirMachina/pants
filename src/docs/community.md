The best way to get help with Pants is to ask!  The Pants community is committed to helping
new Pants adopters get up and running as smoothly and quickly as possible.

There are a two main ways to engage in the Pants conversation:

+ On the [pants-devel][pants-devel] mailing list.
+ On the `#general` channel in the <a href="https://pantsbuild.slack.com/">`pantsbuild`</a> Slack organization.
  You can [send yourself an invite](https://pantsslack.herokuapp.com/) or ask for one on [pants-devel][pants-devel].

Please let us know if you have any questions, issues or bug reports. We'll be glad to help!
